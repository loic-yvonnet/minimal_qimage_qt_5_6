<h1>Minimal QImage with QT 5.6</h1>

Minimal sample with QPainter from a user-defined QWidget. It draws a point at coordinates (0, 0), and displays a simplified coordinates system. When the "change color" button is hit, the point's color is changed (thanks to the usual trick which consists in incrementing hue value of HSL with a prime number).
